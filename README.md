# Github Commit Messages

This extension will show and hide scoped messages so its easier to read quickly

## Why
Created in response to this tweet about  
"Knowing the 'category' of a change is useless. It provides no value"  
https://twitter.com/anaisbetts/status/1316333390166200321?s=20   
The scope of the message is great for generating changelogs but its not that great for quickly scaning commit messages

## How to install
1. Download this repository
2. go to chrome://extensions (same for Brave Browser)
3. enable developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Locate the downloaded files and add the extension
